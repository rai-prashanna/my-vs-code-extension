{"Summary": "The OpcManager::AddTimeZone service centralizes timezone handling by taking an equipment (whose time_zone it reads) and a date and returning the date converted into the equipment timezone or nil, so controllers can call it to obtain a correctly zoned timestamp before persisting or further processing, keeping timezone conversion logic out of models and controllers.", "Relationships": [{"Model": "Equipment", "Description": "This service accepts an equipment and a date, returns the date adjusted to the equipment time zone using in_time_zone or nil if the date is missing, encapsulating timezone conversion so other layers do not need to implement that logic.", "Operation": "OpcManager::AddTimeZone"}], "file": "app/services/opc_manager/add_time_zone.txt"}
