Analyze and summarize the high-level relationships between Ruby on Rails Service classes, Model classes, Operation classes , and Controller classes provided in the input code, focusing on meaningful interactions and beginner-friendly language. Summary should be in one sentence.

# Steps

1. **Identify High-Level Relationships**: Focus on how service or controller classes interact with model classes or operation classes, and how these could be used by controllers at a high level.
2. **Simplify Explanations**: Use abstract and beginner-friendly descriptions without diving into technical implementation details or providing definitions of controllers, services, or models or operations.
3. **Exclude Unimportant Information**: Ignore relationships or details that do not directly contribute to understanding the interaction between services, models, operations, and controllers.
4. **Translate into JSON**: Summarize these interactions and relationships concisely in JSON format for readability.

# Output Format

The output should be formatted as JSON with the following structure:
- **Summary**: A single, concise few sentences providing an overview of the interaction between service, model, Operation classes  and controller classes at a high level. Include a single sentence about the intention or purpose of the class structure.
- **Relationships**: An array of objects detailing specific class relationships:
  - **Model**: The involved model.
  - **Description**: Beginner-friendly explanations of the interaction between the service or controller and the model or operations, including potential use cases in controllers.
  - **Operations**: The involved operation.
  - **Description**: Beginner-friendly explanations of the interaction between the class and the operations.

# Examples

### Input:
```ruby
class EquipmentService < ApplicationService
  def self.find_equipment_by_name(name)
    Equipment.find_by(name: name)
  end
end
```

### Output:
```json
{
  "Summary": "Service classes in the system act as intermediaries performing specific logic or data processing for models, enabling controllers to fulfill application workflows more effectively.",
  "Relationships": [
    {
      "Model": "Equipment",
      "Description": "The EquipmentService interacts with the Equipment model to search for an equipment record by its name. Controllers can use this functionality to facilitate search-based features for users."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Input:
```ruby
class EquipmentController < ApplicationController
  def assign_tag_to_operation
    op_result = TagsOperations::AssignTagsOperation.call(tags:, assignables: @equipment)
    assign_redirect_to op_result
  end
end
```


### Output:
```json
{
  "Summary": "The EquipmentController orchestrates requests and delegates most business work to service and operation classes (notably EquipmentService and several Assignable operations) while using model classes to load and persist data.",
  "Relationships": [
    {
      "Operation": "TagsOperations::DataOperations",
      "Description": "The controller relies on many specialized operation/service classes to perform domain tasks: assigning/unassigning relationships, tagging, moving folders, fetching firmware or configuration, importing data, and other equipment-specific workflows. Controllers gather params and user context, call these services, and use the service result to decide redirects, messages, or rendered JSONâ€”keeping workflow orchestration out of the models themselves."
    }
  ]
}
```
# Notes

- Focus on clear, concise language suitable for beginners.
- Ensure the summary emphasizes the separation of concerns in Rails, where service classes handle complex logic, models interact with the database, and controllers manage responses. Summary should in one sentence longer.
- Exclude irrelevant technical details unless directly tied to the relationships described.
- do include any unicode into JSON content
